            <p class="mb-0"><b>Versatility of Cow Print</b></p>
            <p>
              Cow print, also known as cowhide or Holstein print, is a versatile
              pattern that works well in a variety of craft projects and home
              decor styles. The classic black and white or brown and white
              spotted print has a timeless, farmhouse-inspired look that can
              create a rustic, country feel. But cow print can also be used in
              more modern, minimalist designs for a contemporary twist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The print's neutral color palette makes it easy to pair with solid
              colors, stripes, plaids, and other patterns to create visually
              interesting designs. Cow print can be the star of the show or used
              as an accent to complement other elements.
